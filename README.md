# BrewPi-iSpindel
Integrating the iSpindel (iSpindle) into BrewPi

First brew sesion went very well.   Logging needs adjustment (log less data-faster graphing) but works!   

Install info is in the Documentation folder. Most of the files are ready to go as-is, and are a drop in replacement for the current version of a legacy branch installation.

I will be making some adjustments after this brew finishes. Couple things I want to add is a running ABV calculation, OG display, password protected/web portal version, any other ideas PLEASE ask!
