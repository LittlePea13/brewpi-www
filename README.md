# BrewPi-iSpindel

## The following information is from NFBrewingTech, all credit to integrate iSpindel is his:
Integrating the iSpindel (iSpindle) into BrewPi

Install info is in the Documentation folder. Most of the files are ready to go as-is, and are a drop in replacement for the current version of a legacy branch installation.

I will be making some adjustments after this brew finishes. Couple things I want to add is a running ABV calculation, OG display, password protected/web portal version, any other ideas PLEASE ask!

# LittlePea version:

Here is the repository necessary for brewpi-www, with merged files for iSpindel integration

## Atention, just brewpi-www

I'll be making the other repositores adapted to iSpindel so everything can just be installed running a .sh, but is a work in progress, don't use until ready.

# Added login page

There will be a login page added with the option to have different roles and users. It will be using Mysql, and documentation to do so will be provided. It's currently in use in own website.

# Beers View

There is also a beer page with the beers information, that uses also mysql, with the option of displaying personalized information as how many bottles the user has left.
